# SwissGrid for Symbian S60

Displays the current location in [Swiss grid aka CH1903 aka LV03 coordinates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_coordinate_system).

 * Accuracy 30 meters
 * Timeout 180 seconds

Tested only on [Nokia C5-00](http://developer.nokia.com/Devices/Device_specifications/C5-00_5MP/), my semi-smart phone of choice.

## Getting started

[Download binaries](https://github.com/garamond/s60-swissgrid/blob/master/dist/SwissGrid.zip?raw=true) and install on your phone.
